# Reproducing GPT2

This is a repository reproducing a GPT2-like LLM following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/l8pRSuU81PU) and [repo](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt).

The codes are highly similar with those provided in the above sources. This repo is for recording my learning map. For additional use, please refer to the original sources ([tutorial](https://youtu.be/l8pRSuU81PU), [repo](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt)).
